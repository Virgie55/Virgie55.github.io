        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies youâ€™d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: By the end of this term I hope to become familiar with the basics of coding. I'm very new to html and css, so one main goal is to engrave the basics into my memory. I do remember taking a special studies class back in seventh grade that dove into the topic of coding, but I don't remember one piece of information from that class. Honestly, I already have butterflies!! Just on the first day of class, I was already showing off my 'published' site LOL, so I know along the way there will be plenty of moments where I'll be astonished with the outcome of the codes. I'm excited for all the new programs I'll become familiar with, even though at times there might be headaches that follow along with them. </p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: For project 1, I want to dive into the topic of marijuana. I decided on weed as my topic because I instantly thought of a way to break down my research into five separate pages. My page break down will be the homepage, and then 3 pages dedicated to the three main types of flowers, and finally my fifth page will be a breakdown of the importance of keeping marijuana out of reach from minors and animals. I also decided on this topic because I felt this topic offered a chance to play with photography. Photography and photoshop are not one of my strongest suits, so I thought I could plan a mini photoshoot and try to strengthen my design skills. I plan to connect all my pages together by using the repetetion of cubes, and a limited color palette. My main goal for this project is to have a site running by the due date, I say this only because I'm new to coding and I'm a bit intimidated lol. I think by the end my site will be looking pretty and functional.

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt:This weeks journal prompt, I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.
        </p>
        <p>Response: Well the first person that comes to mind is my boyfriend. As soon as I was given the brief for this first project, I knew it would be a fun task to make the site about marijuana. I also thought of all the ways I could impress him with my new coding skills. My boyfriend, Michael, really inspires me to push myself to out of my comfort zone. I really hope I'm able to pull off my design idea, because I think he'll really like it.</p>

        <h2>Week Four</h2>
        <p>Prompt A: Write about your project. What went well, what went not-so-well, what was your favourite part? What do you wish you knew before you started.</br>Prompt b:
          Considering these articles, make a list of 5 things to keep you going when you feel resistance or discomfort.</p>
        <p>Response A: Honestly, my project one was a mess at first. All of October kind of felt like a shit show to me. I really couldn't understand a lot of the information I was getting from a lot of my classes, as well as the overload from work. After a couple weeks of a mess I finally started to understand the css aspect of our websites a bit better. I would still say that my project 1 has a lot of cleaning up to do, but overall I enjoyed the process of seeing my website/design come to life. I will admit it's pretty frustrating when things don't go as plan, but working around those areas really is in some weird way a confidence booster, Like 'yeah that's right I did that'. I'm really hoping that my project 2 turns out way better, because although it can be frustrating I do enjoy the overall process of coding. I really liked coding the overlay of areas, and what I thought at the moment was "mastering positioning", by the way thank you for that demo of the css grid, because I think I now have a better understanding of positioning. My least favorite part was when I would make the smallest of errors, because I really didn't know what wasn't working, I know I just need to have more patience, because there lies my issue lol. I wish beforehand I would've focused on the grid, because a lot of my design was flying on different areas of the page, for my next project I will spend some heavy dedicated time on my wireframes and design comps. </br>
        Response B: <ul>
          <li>Remind myself that there is a goal working in progress
          </li>
          <li>Remind myself it won't last forever</li>
          <li>Keep in mind, that everyone else is going through their own struggles</li>
          <li>Taking a moment to breathe helps me out </li>
          <li>Rewarding myself once the situation is over</li>
        </ul> </p>
        <p>Inspiring site of the week: At this point every website that is highly functioning is very inspiring lol I love the background video and fixed positioning of the nav. <a href="https://www.ruckusmarketing.com/?utm_source=10BestDesigns&utm_medium=Directory&utm_term=10BestDesigns&utm_content=10BestDesigns&utm_campaign=10BestDesigns">ruckusmarketing.com</a></p>

        <h2>Week Six</h2>
        <p>Prompt:Design Journal Prompt - What did you choose the business/cause that you chose? Why do you think your redesign will be better? What area/content will you focus on in your redesign? Look at two other similar websites. What stands out about those sites? what bothers you abut them? How will you improve things in your own design.</p>
        <p>Response: I decided to work on redoing the ice cream brand Ruby Jewel's website. I found that I didn't really find their site aesthetically pleasing. I felt instead it seemed a bit outdated and bland, I just felt the site needed some touch ups and I also felt that this direction could fuse both my own personal skills with some new approaches I have not tried, in regards to design work. So I deicided to check out other competing ice cream brand sites to see how they solved this issue. I checked out Salt n Straw and, what's the scoop. What I really liked from both of these sites were that Nav stays fixed on the page at all times, I also really liked the images used on the home page, really draws in the type of consumers/ community that revolve around these shops. I really didn't find much that I didn't like from these two sites, if anything they just encouraged me to make Ruby Jewel's new website give the brand a luxurious feel. When I compare my design comps to the old ruby Jewel website, I can't hekp but feel excited because I defintely like the direction I'm headed in.    </p>
