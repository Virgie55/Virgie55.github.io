        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies youâ€™d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: By the end of this term I hope to become familiar with the basics of coding. I'm very new to html and css, so one main goal is to engrave the basics into my memory. I do remember taking a special studies class back in seventh grade that dove into the topic of coding, but I don't remember one piece of information from that class. Honestly, I already have butterflies!! Just on the first day of class, I was already showing off my 'published' site LOL, so I know along the way there will be plenty of moments where I'll be astonished with the outcome of the codes. I'm excited for all the new programs I'll become familiar with, even though at times there might be headaches that follow along with them. </p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: For project 1, I want to dive into the topic of marijuana. I decided on weed as my topic because I instantly thought of a way to break down my research into five separate pages. My page break down will be the homepage, and then 3 pages dedicated to the three main types of flowers, and finally my fifth page will be a breakdown of the importance of keeping marijuana out of reach from minors and animals. I also decided on this topic because I felt this topic offered a chance to play with photography. Photography and photoshop are not one of my strongest suits, so I thought I could plan a mini photoshoot and try to strengthen my design skills. I plan to connect all my pages together by using the repetetion of cubes, and a limited color palette. My main goal for this project is to have a site running by the due date, I say this only because I'm new to coding and I'm a bit intimidated lol. I think by the end my site will be looking pretty and functional.

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt:This weeks journal prompt, I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.
        </p>
        <p>Response: Well the first person that comes to mind is my boyfriend. As soon as I was given the brief for this first project, I knew it would be a fun task to make the site about marijuana. I also thought of all the ways I could impress him with my new coding skills. My boyfriend, Michael, really inspires me to push myself to out of my comfort zone. I really hope I'm able to pull off my design idea, because I think he'll really like it.</p>
